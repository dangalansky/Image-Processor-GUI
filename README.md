# Image-Processor-GUI
GUI with basic image processing functionality including: flip, resize, crop and gamma correction. 

This is mostly an exercise for myself to more fully understand basic image processing functionality. As I move on through my OpenCV course, I want to make sure I understand the basic tenets of the library and how images as arrays/matrices are actually affected by functions and filters.

The GUI isn't particularly pretty by my standards and I do not intend to stylize it any further. Though I do intend to add more functions including: threshold, inversion, and equalization.
